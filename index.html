        <h1>Mahber Theater Asmara</h1>
        <h3>Who are Matea</h3>
        <p>Mahber Tyatr Asmera (Mat'A &trade;) or Asmara Theater Association was founded by interested citizens to push for an Eritrean cultural and national renaissance. Besides the association's goal of promoting Eritrean culture and identity, it also strongly pushed to empower and embolden the youth to stand up against Ethiopian rule by promoting resistance through music and poetry. For this reason, the association was always under heavy surveillance and censorship by the Ethiopian government. But this didn't stop many of the members from writing many cryptic songs instilling patriotic fervor in the youth.</p>
        <p>Seemingly romantic or simple songs about life in general would have a different inigorating meaning to many youth of the time. Notable songs can be:</p>

        <ul type="circle"> 
            <li> <strong>Tefetawit kotsli </strong> By Osman Abdurahim (the beloved leaf,referring to the green olive branch on the blue Eritrean flag from the days of the government of Eritrea)</li><br>
            
            <li><strong>Eti gezana abi hidmo, tikan kunchi meliomo</strong> by Tbereh Tesfahuney (our big abode, infested with bugs and fleas, unwelcome occupiers)</li><br>
            
            <li><strong>Shgey habuni</strong> by Tewelde Redda (give me my torch, longing for independence</li><br>
            
            <li><strong>Adeye Adeye beal men eyom ztelemu</strong>by Atewebrhan Segid (my country, who were those that betrayed you? </li><br>
            

        </ul>

<p>Another accomplishment of Mat'A to be noted is the inclusion and empowerment of <a href="https://shabait.com/2021/11/15/eritrean-women-and-arts/" target="_blank">Eritrean women artists</a>.One of the notable singers from this time was Tibereh Tesfahuney.</p>
